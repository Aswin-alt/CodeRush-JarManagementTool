# CodeRush JAR Management Tool - Development Roadmap

## ✅ **Foundation Complete** - Step 1 Accomplished

### 🏗️ **Multi-Module Architecture Established**

We have successfully created a robust, extensible foundation that supports all 6 planned features:

1. ✅ **Project Structure**: Multi-module Gradle build with clear separation of concerns
2. ✅ **Build System**: Gradle 8.8 with centralized dependency management
3. ✅ **Core Interfaces**: Generic `ProjectAnalyzer<T,R>` interface for all features
4. ✅ **Model Framework**: Base classes for requests, results, and exceptions
5. ✅ **Technology Stack**: Java 21, ASM, Jersey, PicoCLI, and modern web technologies

## 🎯 **Six Main Features - Modular Design**

### **Feature 1: JAR Upgrade Impact Analysis** 
- **Purpose**: Identify classes/methods affected by JAR upgrades
- **Inputs**: Project ZIP + Old JAR + New JAR  
- **Implementation**: `JarUpgradeAnalyzer` with ASM-based comparison
- **Status**: 🔄 Architecture complete, ready for implementation

### **Feature 2: Unused & Duplicate JAR Detection**
- **Purpose**: Find unused dependencies and duplicate JARs
- **Inputs**: Project ZIP file
- **Implementation**: `UnusedJarAnalyzer` with usage analysis
- **Status**: 🔄 Architecture complete, ready for implementation

### **Feature 3: Deprecated API Usage Identification**  
- **Purpose**: Find deprecated method usage in project code
- **Inputs**: Project ZIP file
- **Implementation**: `DeprecatedApiAnalyzer` (JDeprscan vs ASM - best choice TBD)
- **Status**: 🔄 Architecture complete, ready for implementation

### **Feature 4: JAR Version Comparison**
- **Purpose**: Detailed changeset between JAR versions  
- **Inputs**: JAR1 (lower) + JAR2 (higher)
- **Implementation**: `JarComparisonAnalyzer` with bytecode diff
- **Status**: 🔄 Architecture complete, ready for implementation

### **Feature 5: Vulnerability Identification**
- **Purpose**: Security scanning using OSV-Scanner API
- **Inputs**: Project ZIP file  
- **Implementation**: `VulnerabilityAnalyzer` with Google OSV integration
- **Status**: 🔄 Architecture complete, ready for implementation

### **Feature 6: Ant Changes for JAR Upgrade** *(Future)*
- **Purpose**: Generate Ant build script updates
- **Status**: 🚀 Planned for future implementation

## 🧩 **Why This Modular Design Works**

### **1. Feature Independence**
Each feature is implemented as an independent analyzer:
```java
public class JarUpgradeAnalyzer implements ProjectAnalyzer<JarUpgradeRequest, JarUpgradeResult> {
    @Override
    public JarUpgradeResult analyze(JarUpgradeRequest request) {
        // Feature-specific implementation
    }
}
```

### **2. Consistent Interface**  
All features share the same contract:
- Input validation through `AnalysisRequest.validate()`
- Error handling through `AnalysisException` hierarchy
- Progress reporting through common mechanisms
- Result formatting through `AnalysisResult` base class

### **3. Shared Infrastructure**
Common utilities are centralized:
- **ZIP/JAR Processing**: Unified file handling across features
- **ASM Integration**: Shared bytecode analysis helpers  
- **Caching Layer**: Performance optimization for all features
- **Progress Reporting**: Real-time updates via WebSocket

### **4. Multiple Interfaces**
Each feature is accessible through:
- **Web UI**: Interactive analysis with progress reporting
- **REST API**: `/api/v1/analyze/{feature-name}` endpoints
- **CLI**: `jar-analyzer {feature-command}` commands
- **Programmatic**: Direct Java API usage

### **5. Extensible Design**
Adding new features requires only:
- Implement `ProjectAnalyzer<T,R>` interface
- Create request/result models
- Add REST endpoint and CLI command
- Update UI components

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation Strategy**

### **Core Technology Decisions Made:**

1. **ASM vs JDeps vs JDeprscan**: 
   - ASM for deep bytecode analysis (Features 1, 4)
   - JDeps for dependency analysis where appropriate  
   - JDeprscan vs ASM for deprecation detection (Feature 3) - will choose best approach

2. **Input Processing**:
   - Unified ZIP extraction and validation
   - JAR metadata caching for performance
   - Multi-threaded processing for large projects

3. **External Integration**:
   - OSV-Scanner API integration for vulnerability scanning
   - Graceful fallback when external services unavailable

4. **Output Generation**:
   - Multiple format support (JSON, XML, CSV, HTML)
   - Interactive web reports with drill-down capability
   - Batch processing support for CI/CD integration

## 🚦 **Ready for Feature Development!**

The foundation is complete and ready for implementing the six core features. Each feature can now be developed independently while leveraging the shared infrastructure and maintaining consistency across the entire tool.

**Next Step**: Choose which feature to implement first and begin the development process with the established modular architecture!
